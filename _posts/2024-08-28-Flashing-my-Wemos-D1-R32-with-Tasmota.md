# Flashing my Wemos D1 R32 with Tasmota

I've bought a couple of Wemos D1 R32 from AliExpress. Every time I'm installing Tasmota on them, I kinda struggle to set the right parameters and etc. This time I'm going to take notes on how I did it.

## Download Tasmota

So, for this specific project, I'll be connecting the [AO2YYUW](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/_A02YYUW_Waterproof_Ultrasonic_Sensor_SKU_SEN0311) Ultrasonic Sensor to the Wemos Board, the idea here is to measure the water level in a tank. To do that, I'll need the [ESP32 specific version](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/releases/download/v14.2.0/tasmota32.factory.bin) of Tasmota. 

By the way, the specific version I'm mentioning here is the `tasmota32.factory.bin` file, which is the one that need to be used when flashing Tasmota for the first time.

If I was using an ESP8266 based board, the needed version would be [tasmota-sensors.bin](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/releases/), but the Tasmota ESP32 version already include sensor support. Let me download it then:

```
wget https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/releases/download/v14.2.0/tasmota32.factory.bin
```

## Preparing the needed software

After the download is finished, I need to install the proper software to flash the binary.

For this, [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) will be needed:
```
brew install python3
```

Next, I can create a virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv esptool
```

Activate it:
```
source ./esptool/bin/activate
```

Install the script:
```
pip3 install esptool
```

## Using the tool to flash the board

Normally, I would use a [USB-serial device converter](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Getting-Started/#serial-programmer) to perform this operation, but the D1 R32 board has a serial programmer built-in, so to flash Tasmota I just need to connect the board to a USB port using a [micro USB cable](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MicroB_USB_Plug.jpg).

After the connection, the device can be seen in `/dev/`:
```
ls /dev | grep usb
```

Output:
```
cu.usbserial-1420
tty.usbserial-1420
```

Finally I can flash the firmware:
```
esptool.py --port /dev/cu.usbserial-1420 write_flash 0x0 tasmota32.factory.bin
```

Output:
```
esptool.py v4.7.0

## Sensor Pinout

The pinout should be the following:

Red cable (sensor) <-> 5V (Wemos D1 R32)
Black cable (sensor) <-> Ground (Wemos D1 R32)
Yellow Cable (sensor) <-> Any IOX port (Wemos D1 R32) (Trigger)
White Cable (sensor) <-> Any IOX port (Wemos D1 R32) (Echo)

I can take note of the IOX ports and set them to SR04 Tri and SR04 echo on Tasmota Web UI, if it doesn't work I can invert them. For more information and images, here are some resources:

- [HC-SR04 ultrasonic ranging sensor â€” Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/HC-SR04/#tasmota-settings)

## Connecting to Tasmota using Screen

Just in case, if I needed to connect to Tasmota using screen command, this was the one:
```
screen /dev/cu.usbserial-1420 115200
```

## Adding an antenna

One final step to complete the process is adding a Wifi Antenna. This is needed because without it the signal is very, very poor. Since this is more a hardware endeavor, I'll be linking the guide here: [How to add an external antenna to an ESP board](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/how-to-add-an-external-antenna-to-an-esp-board/131601F).

That should be it!!
